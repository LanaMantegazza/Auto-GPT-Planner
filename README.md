# Auto-GPT-Planner
A planner for Auto-GPT that uses GPT-4 to create a detailed set of atomic steps that Auto-GPT can follow in order to increase its speed and efficiency. Furthermore, this can prevent Auto-GPT from getting stuck in loops and work towards the final objective with a more concrete plan for both the AI and the end user.

## planner.py
The code for planning the tasks, returning the plan for Auto-GPT to follow in JSON format.

## lana.py
A very simple and hacky logger I bodged together in like an hour.

## output_sample.log
An incomplete extract of the output from the planner.py file to the console.

## task_planner_prompt.txt
Just realising now that I forgot to add this to the repo before I left, I will add it when I get home tonight. Sorry ðŸ™ƒ

# Version
The current state of this repository is simply a code dump of the code I've been using to prototype the idea. A forked repository contributing to the Auto-GPT should follow shortly.
