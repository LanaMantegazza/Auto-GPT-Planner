# Auto-GPT-Planner
A planner for Auto-GPT that uses GPT-4 to create a detailed set of atomic steps that Auto-GPT can follow in order to increase its speed and efficiency. Furthermore, this can prevent Auto-GPT from getting stuck in loops and work towards the final objective with a more concrete plan for both the AI and the end user.

# Version
The current state of this repository is simply a code dump of the code I've been using to prototype the idea. A forked repository contributing to the Auto-GPT should follow shortly.
